This is their third studio album, released on August 24, 2009 featuring 12 tracks and a runtime of 39min 19sec. Many found this album to be weaker than the band’s previous two releases (”Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not” on January 23, 2006 and “Favourite Worst Nightmare” on April 23, 2007). However, as stated by lead vocalist and lyricist Alex Turner in 2011, Humbug was “as important, if not more so [compared to the first two records], on our journey of getting to where we are right now” because of how polarising it was and expanded their range. 
    </p>
<p>It has been described musically as “psychedelic rock, hard rock, stoner rock, and desert rock.” </p>

This is their fourth studio album, released on June 6, 2011 featuring 12 tracks and a runtime of 40min 11sec. Compared to their fast-paced, “rockier” past albums, this album focused on slower, love-themed ballads. Most of the tracks were written by Alex on acoustic guitar in his bedroom, further amplifying the ballad-style prevalent on the album.
    </p>
<p>It draws influences from “post-punk, country music, surf rock, and glam rock.” In terms of lyrics, it expresses themes of romance, heartbreak, ageing, and loneliness.</p>

This is their fifth studio album, released on September 9, 2013 featuring 12 tracks and a runtime of 41min 47sec. It is the commercially the most successful album for the band and was the first to be influenced by hip hop. 
    </p>
  <p>It draws inspiration from a wide range of genres, including “psychedelic rock, blues rock, hard rock, heavy metal, desert rock, R&B, and soul.” Its lyrics convey darker themes of “tainted romance” and loneliness. </p>
