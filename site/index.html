<h1>Arctic Monkeys</h1>
</div>
<h3>Background</h3>

  <p>They are a rock band originating from Sheffield, England. The current member lineup consists of lead singer Alex Turner, guitarist Jamie Cook, bassist Nick O'Malley, and drummer Matt Helders. With the rise of the Internet, they soon became very popular after forming in 2002 and debuting with their first ep, Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys, in 2005. Their first two singles, "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor" and "When the Sun Goes Down", both reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and their debut studio album, "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not" (2006), peaked at number one on the UK, Irish, and Australian album charts. </p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>In 2017 I was forced to listen to them for the first time because my best friend was obsessed with them. I didn't start listening to them out of my own free will until last year, in 2023. Now, they are one of my favorite bands.</p>
<p> This site features my three favorite albums from them. </p>
