<h2> About </h2>
  <div class="box">
    <p>
This is their fourth studio album, released on June 6, 2011. Compared to their fast-paced, "rockier" past albums, this album focused on slower, love-themed ballads. Most of the tracks were written by Alex on acoustic guitar in his bedroom, further amplifying the ballad-style prevalent on the album.
    </p>
<p>It draws influences from "post-punk, country music, surf rock, and glam rock." In terms of lyrics, it expresses themes of romance, heartbreak, ageing, and loneliness.</p>
