<h2> About </h2>
  <div class="box">
    <p>
This is their third studio album, released on August 24, 2009. Many found this album to be weaker than the bandâ€™s previous two releases ("Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not" on January 23, 2006 and "Favourite Worst Nightmare" on April 23, 2007). However, as stated by lead vocalist and lyricist Alex Turner in 2011, Humbug was "as important, if not more so [compared to the first two records], on our journey of getting to where we are right now" because of how polarising it was and expanded their range.
    </p>
<p>It has been described musically as "psychedelic rock, hard rock, stoner rock, and desert rock." </p>
